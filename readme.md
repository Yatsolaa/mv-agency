# Development
Gulp processes source files from `dev/src` to `assets` folder.

### Before you start
1. Make sure you've installed Nodejs.
2. Upload the `dev` folder right to the root of your theme.
3. Run `npm install` from the `dev` folder.

### Build source files
* Run one of the following command from the `dev` folder:
    * `npm run dev` - watching and compiling the source files for development.
    * `npm run build` - compiling the source files for production.
